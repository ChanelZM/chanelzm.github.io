#Webapp from scratch

##Assignment 2

###Pros of using JS libraries/frameworks

####1: Less code
When there is less code there is less maintenance time(David Walsh, september 5 2007).

####2: Visitor usage
The speed of visitor usage is faster. The speed of a script is the most important part(David Walsh, september 5 2007).

#####Note: Different source says otherwise
Using frameworks will slow down your website, because they're massive (Derek Banas, May 1 2010).

####3: More security
You can let the developers of the framework know when something's wrong and they will fix it (Editorial Team, May 28 2015).

####4: Browser consistency
You don't really need te make any adjustments, they look the same in every browser (Derek Banas, May 1 2010).

###Cons of using JS libraries/frameworks

####1: Trends
Library trends change every time you blink your eyes. In the past 5 years, 10 libraries came out. How will you keep up (Francois-Xavier P. Darveau, no date)?

####2: Shortcuts
You don't learn the basics of JS, you learn shortcuts. So when something goes wrong, you have to dig in pure JS and if you don't have a deep understanding of JS, you will lose a lot of time figuring out where the problem lies (Francois-Xavier P. Darveau, no date).

####3: Limitation
You can't change the frameworks behavior, so what you can do is limited (Editorial Team, May 28 2015)s.

####4: Complete new way of coding
To learn a library, you will have to learn a complete new way of coding (Derek Banas, May 1 2010).

##Assignment 3

###Pros of a single page web app

####1: They give a more fluid user experience
When the user has a lot of interaction with the product, it helps for a richer UX (Anthony Ingram-Westover, June 10 2015). The user experience is simple and lineair, there is a beginning, middle and an end (Speider Schneider, no date).

####2: Larger conversion rate
In a study 37signals did they found out that Single page webapps have 37.5% more signups than a multiple page version (Speider Schneider, no date).

####3: Debugging
SPA's are more easily to debug with Chrome. Network operations can be monitored and you can inspect the elements (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

####4: Easier to make a mobile application
You can just use the backend code for the webapplication when you're developing a mobile application (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

####5: Development
The development of a SPA is more simplified. You don't need code to render it on the server (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

####6: Local storage
Because an SPA only sends a request once to the server, every data that is needed will be stored local and the SPA will work offline (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

###Cons of a single page web app

####1: Speed
On initial page load they tend to be slower, because it also requires loading the framework (Anthony Ingram-Westover, June 10 2015). But they don't have to load again when the user moves on to the next state (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

####2: Navigation within the browser
With the dynamic loading of the content and not switching between pages, the browser has problems with the reload, back and forward button, because it cannot always distinguish what has te be considered a step and just an action (Anthony Ingram-Westover, June 10 2015).

####3: Search Engine Optimization
It is very tricky to make it findable in a search engine, because you're using AJAX to load in the data and updating it without refreshing (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

####4: JavaScript
To work, SPA needs JS to be present and enabled in de browser. In some browsers the default setting for JS is disabled (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).

####5: Security
SPA's are less secure. Because of Cross-Site scripting, attackers can inject client side scripting into the application of of other users (Pawel Skólski, December 1 2016).
