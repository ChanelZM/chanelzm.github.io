###Pros of using JS libraries/frameworks

####1: You do more with less code
When there is less code there is less maintenance time(David Walsh, september 5 2007).

####2: Visitor usage is faster
The speed of a script is the most important part(David Walsh, september 5 2007).

#####Note: Different source saids otherwise
Using frameworks will slow down your website, because they're massive (Derek Banas, May 1 2010).

####3: Frameworks have more security implemented
You can let the developers of the framework know when something's wrong and they will fix it (Editorial Team, May 28 2015).

###Cons of using JS libraries/frameworks

####1: Library trends change every time you blink your eyes
In the past 5 years, 10 libraries came out. How will you keep up (Francois-Xavier P. Darveau, no date)?

####2: You don't learn the basics of JS, you learn shortcuts
So when something goes wrong, you have to dig in pure JS and if you don't have a deep understanding of JS, you will lose a lot of time figuring out where the problem lies (Francois-Xavier P. Darveau, no date).

####3: Limitation
You can't change the frameworks behavior, so what you can do is limited (Editorial Team, May 28 2015)s.

####4: Complete new way of coding
To learn a library, you will have to learn a complete new way of coding (Derek Banas, May 1 2010).
