#Webapp from scratch
##Introduction
Did you ever wanted to create your own quiz but didn't know what to ask? This SPA already thought of the questions for you. The only thing you have to do is pick the questions you like, bundle them and send them to your email, so you can use them when you're having a get-together and don't know what to do with these boring people.

###What am I looking at?
Quizpose provides a generator that gives you possible quiz questions for your own quiz. The questions are loaded from several API's with different categories.

###Why did you build this?
I was taking a class called Webapp from scratch (explains itself) and one of the requirements for the assignment was "Get data from an API to fill your HTML". I decided to use a Quiz API but not to create a quiz (because that is clich√©) but to make a quizgenerator. Why use your brain if you can use API's?

##References
*Clears throat*
I would like to thank my classmates for helping me through tough codeblocks that set me back for hours. If they weren't here, my SPA would be much more crappy.

I would like to thank the people of Stack Overflow. If I forgot something or something small wasn't working I could always count on answers there.

##Wishlist
+ More Styling
+ When generate quiz is clicked, removing the non selected questions
+ Sending the user the selected questions to email
+ filterValues not remotely typed
+ Questions in random order
